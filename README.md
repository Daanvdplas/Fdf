# Fdf

This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

## To run

Run the executable with a map formatted as the examples in the directory: test_maps.

Use 'u' to zoom out.
Use 'i' to zoom in.
Use '=' to increase z value (height).
Use '-' to decrease z value (height).
Use arrows to move the object in the window.
Use 'a' and 'd' to rotate the object around its z-axis.
Use 'w' and 's' to rotate the object around its y-axis.
Use 'e' and 'z' to rotate the object around its x-axis.

Have fun!

### Progress

Fdf was a really cool project. I used some basic math as well as bit shifting. Moreover, initially my input handling was very inefficient which made it impossible to run bigger maps. It made me realize the importance of writing efficient code.
